# Finance Fraud Detection System (Batch + Streaming)

**Project Status: Under Development** 

This repository contains an end-to-end **Finance Fraud Detection Data Engineering system**, developed as part of the **Data Engineering 2 – Big Data Architecture** module for the MSc in Applied Data Science and Analytics.

The project demonstrates **batch processing, real-time streaming, and basic machine learning integration** using a scalable data architecture. The system is currently under active development and will be incrementally enhanced.

## Project Overview

Financial institutions process thousands of transactions every hour, making real-time fraud detection critical.  
This project simulates a **fraud detection pipeline** that processes financial transactions using:

- **Batch analytics** for historical insights and model training
- **Stream processing** for near real-time fraud signals
- **Machine Learning** for fraud classification
- **Monitoring and logging** for system observability

The system is designed to follow **modern cloud-based data engineering principles** while remaining simple and explainable.

## Objectives

- Design a complete **data processing architecture**
- Handle **both batch and streaming data**
- Perform **basic fraud detection using ML**
- Apply **performance analysis (Little’s Law)**
- Demonstrate **scalability, fault tolerance, and monitoring**
- Deliver a **working, documented system**
